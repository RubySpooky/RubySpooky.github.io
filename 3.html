<h1 style="color:#b536da">Why conservativism and reactionary movements are gaining traction</h1>
<p> So through these last few years, reactionary movements have been gaining traction in the united states, leading to people getting mroe violent and committing crimes like shootings.</p>
<p>But this situation is similar to what happened during germany dbefore the nazi party took voer complete control. First of all, it was ungovernab le, congress didn't do anything to govern, they disagreed on everything, and as a result, most decisions aside from giving occasional bailouts to capitalist pigs, where made by the executive branch.</p>
<p>Then the military used resources from paramilitaries in order to restrict what the people feared, which was a bolshevik revolution. So there were state sanctioned paramilitaries running around killing leftists. </p>
<p> This goverment inefficiency, coupled with a war and a pandemic, brought scarcity to once was a plentiful country filled with opportunity. So unemployement rose, labor unions couldn' ever work due to congress blocking every move they had. Which led to capitalists taking more control, which led to more unemployement and wage reduction. The goverment also had to pay massive amounts of debt, so it started printing money and producing inflation, which led to workers, once again, getting robbed of their labor even more.</p>
<p>The order differs, but you can see how the american situation is similar.</p>
<p>Now the main difference, is that there was this myth called the backstabber or something like that, which consisted of german people believing that the jews and communists and x, y and z groups were the culprits of losing the war and not their own goverment. Pretty stupid. Now the americans have this old great replacement theory, which consists of white people fearing getting breeded into extinction by black people, which says tons of things about their own self-worth. I mean, if they believe they will get overbreeded by black people unless they actively kill and oppress them in every single way, it gives the idea, that white people are cowards who need an unfair advantage for some natural selection stuff (those conservatives really love the natural selection, despite their own theory contradicting their belief in them being superior. </p>
<p>Another difference is that, these american groups aren't united by some great oh supreme leader whos actually competent. If they did, then we are fucking dead. Because GOP are only in it for the money, trump is actually dumb, and the rest of conservative leaders share one of these 2 factors. So unless one leader comes and unites them and leades them into action, then they will do harm, tons of harm. Even without a leader they are harming us aren't they. </p>
<p>This means that there is still time before nazis 2.0 rises up and starts to kill all of the gays. And remember that in germany, nazis wasn't a thing until after the great deppression. So we are in this period of crisis, that the alt-roght benefits itself in, because the goverment doesn't do jack shit. And if it goes on for long enough that everyones life is reduced to trash, then nazi 2.0 will rise up and start gaining traction. Because these people are worse than the germans before nazi. They are already brainwashed by all that trashy FOX news, they just need a leader that isnt related to pizzas or something.</p>

<p>Another thing is that the issue somehow stopped in the 2000s. Remember in the 90's how there was waco ruby, and then oklahoma, alongside those columbine kids. Those were actually alt-right figures, just before the alt right was created, and it seems like it suddenly stopped in 9/11. and after 9/11 americans just started to kill iraqis and afghanis rather than themselves. I dont know whats behind this pattern, but beware.</p>}
<p>So summarizing my rant here, the current situation is similar to the nazis, except there is not moustache guy, so prepare before moustache man arrives. And that goverment inefficiency is pushing all of this. And finally that the whole movement stopped  suddenly during 2001-2008 before starting all over again in 2008 with the whole barack hussein obama stuff.</p>
