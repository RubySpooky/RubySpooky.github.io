<h1 style="color:#b536da">How the Gringo state has pushed discrimination and progress to benefit itself</h1>
<p> So you are wondering how all these shooters and laws restricting liberties are going on and becoming more widespread as time goes on. The answer to this question relies in some little bits of history here and there. So let's go to the beginning of all of this. </p>
<img style="float: right; margin: 0 0 0 15px;"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Virgin_Forest_in_United_States%2C_1620.png/1920px-Virgin_Forest_in_United_States%2C_1620.png" alt="virgin Forest area in 1620" width="500px">

<p>The first violation to liberty that ocurred in those territories where in the colony times, where cities where being founded, indigenous tribes were massacred (nothing changed in this regard), and the nature was being destroyed. From this point onward, the oppresions carried by the european male (related to religious traditions back in europe, for example the ones experienced by women or eastern europeans), combined with the new experiences that the new continent brought them, like tribes or an actual forest. This resulted in the europeans realization that they could restrict all the freedoms they could without any consequences.</p>
<p>This realization made the european chop down trees like there wasn't a tomorrow, bonded or killed the tribes to their name, and created what we know as the institutions of the 13 colonies that rebelled against britain due to taxation.</p>
<p>After the independence, americans had these newfound power to oppress others, and like their ancestors, resolved to oppress every living creature that wasn't like them. One of the more long-standing traditions of oppression in modern gringo culture is the citizenship. Citizens were a way to give privilege to white men easily, as they gave a pseudo-scientific explanation as to why men were given certain unalienable rights and not women or black people. </p>
<p>Now this carried on until the americans had their first contact with their other americans (Mexico, Colombia and other peers from the south). They gave the same treatment to the hispanic as the black person. The black person, the hispanic, and the indigenous were fused into what we now know as People of Color, due to their similar treatment by their white neighbors. </p>
<p>Americans also decided to steal land under the name of manifest destiny, harming POC universally. Without giving a thought whatsoever to the effects it might have on nature or the cultures. This is where the american stops being an american, and starts being what I call a gringo.</p>
<p>The gringos after they stole a bunch of land, had a tantrum over oppressing POC with the method of slavery. Which culminated into civl war, and the 14th amendment. In true state fashion, the amendment gave citizenship to POC <strong>in theory, and not in practice.</strong> Giving false hope to many POC in the United States of getting the same freedom as a white man. Alongside the development of useless pieces of paper that give hope to people, the civil war also kickstarted the development of capitalism. Which tied everyone; POC and white, men and women; into a wage slavery market that only the rich white man controlled. Which is what we know as a capitalist. </p>
<p>Now on at the end of the gilded age, there was a big threat over American society. Which was anarchism, anarchism on that point fighted for equality amongst all the people, many were pacifists, but some of them instigated fear into the capitalists by killing many of their peers.</p>
<p>Capitalists decided to treat this problem by false change, with the figure of the progressive era, they gave away some of the rights for many people, especially women, in order to prevent a full-on revolution to the government. This calmed down the anger of the people and extinguished the flames anarchism instituted to the capitalists.</p>
<p>After this "progressive era", ocurred happened, the great war transcurred. Which will ended with the profitization by the gringos against the europeans and africans, and the instauration of the USSR. The USSR ended making the finishing move on anarchism, by imprisioning or killing many relevant anarchist figures. The gringos as a result, decided to pull back most rights given during the progressive era. Ending with more or less the same situation from the guilded age but worse.</p>
<p>During the guilded era up until the interwar period, the gringos rampaged across asia and america. Which expanded capitalism, and reduced rights for POC universally, not just on the united states, but on the whole world. So capitalism expanded on what the original gringos did, and ended becoming the gringos.</p>
<p>So the great depression ocurred, alongside the rapid industrialization from the USSR. The people were angry, and wanted rights. But the gringos decided to do a great idea, the same thing they did with anarchism. Give away some of the rights taken away with the "New Deal" and the "New Frontier", to calm down the ire of the people.</p>
<p> This quickly went out of control, as the people revolutionized against the government either way. This is what we know as the civil rights movement. The people actually got some of their rights that were taken away by the state back. The FBI and CIA had a great idea to destroy this new movement, via a similar tactic done in many latin american countries before: the political assasination. The FBI killed many relevant figures to the civl rights movement, and left many others fearing for their lives. But this still didn't work.</p>
<p>They tried another idea, which was using the people against themselves, fueling the idea of a cultural war for the conservatives and starting the current political landscape that we see today. Conservatives revolted against the progress and freedom that their peers tried to give to everyone. Resulting in the failure of the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Some of the arguments used by conservatives to extinguish the ERA project were the following: that single-sex bathrooms would be eliminated and same-sex couples would be able to get married if the amendment were passed, that the amendment would invalidate protective laws such as alimony and eliminate the tendency for mothers to obtain custody over their children in divorce cases, that women would be subject to conscription and be required to have military combat roles in future wars if it were passed. Sounds familiar to you?</p>
<p>But these conservative movement needed support from the center and needed to manipulate the left into doing what they wanted. They accomplished this by taking some of the ideas popularized by their nazi forefathers, propaganda. They used another south american tactic, neoliberalism, and made it the economic model of the country. They taught that only neoliberalism would be viable and the only "correct" economic model for the United States.</p>
<p>The gringo accomplished in splitting the people, and in keeping the profits to itself. The dissolution of the USSR only helped in their goals, as now neoliberalism would be global via globalism. In order to hide the truth from the people, the gringos all united in creating and modelling the enemy that will make the people angry at for some time before they discovered that they were tricked. These enemies were bombers, talibans, shooters, trump. They even manipulated a biological problem to be a political one. If they can do that, they will do anything they want unto you.</p>
<p>To finish this, what we are living with is just the people being distracted by another artificial enemy. While the rights gained in the 1960s are being taken away right in front of our eyes.</p>
