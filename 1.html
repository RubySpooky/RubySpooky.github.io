<h1 style="color:#b536da">Why citizenship class is useless</h1>
<p>To start out, citizenship and government class is always, always about the state, about how it functions and how it theoretically should work. This is a scam nothing but useless waste of time and mental effort.</p>
<p>First of all, that class always talks about how the state is important to all of us, and that we should know how it works. You know how this works. But the state is always the defender of violence and the minority over the majority. And one of the ways, the state avoids being used by the majority over the minority. Is by bureocracy, by making the state as complicated and nonunderstandable for the common person to understand. They rob you of your power to know exactly what the state does right now.</p>
<p>As a result, the study of goverment is the study of the bureocracy and political science, which are useless. You are trying to figure out what is designed to not be figured out. You will end up chasing your own tail.</p>
<p>Second of all, the state is an unnecesary concept, the state is not meant to exist, it exists to oppress us and take away from our rights to give them to itself. A leecher in a sense.</p>
<p>So the whole concept of citizenship itself is a scam, it's the state giving some of your rights back because it wants to. They can be perfectly taken away.</p>
<p>Third of all, the whole study of political science is the study of the state <strong>in theory, not in practice.</strong></p>
<p>The state in theory never ever works in practice. In theory the state says it will guarantee a set of rights and responsabilities, that it has a certain amount of institutions that will guarantee does rights, and provides welfare. In practice it does none of those things, it keeps the rich in power, and provides the right for them, all responsability falls onto us. Welfare is getting erradicated day by day. Institutions only for white powerful rich men. </p>
<p>The more we believe in political science, the more we will believe on the lies of the state, all the treachery it has specifically made to keep us blind in darkness. Believing in the class of citizenship and government, is believing on nothing but deep lies. That is why it's trash, absolute fucking trash.</p>
